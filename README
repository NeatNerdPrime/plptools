plptools
--------

https://github.com/rrthomas/plptools/

plptools is a suite of programs for transferring files to and from EPOC
devices, as well as backing them up, installing software, and setting the
clock. See below for build instructions and HISTORY for some history.

See the man pages for documentation: ncpd(8), plpftp(1), sisinstall(1),
plpprintd(8), and, where installed, plpfuse(8).


Building from source
--------------------

To build plpfuse, the following packages are required:

  FUSE: https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse
  libattr: https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/attr

These packages come with most GNU/Linux distributions. To build plptools,
the development packages (typically ending in -dev or -devel) must be
installed. If they are not installed, plpfuse will not be built, but the
rest of plptools will still work.

If building from a git checkout, first run:

./bootstrap --skip-po

plptools uses GNU autotools, so the usual sequence of commands works:

./configure
make
make install

In addition to the usual options, configure understands the following:

  --enable-debug

       builds debugging versions of the programs and libplp

  --with-serial=/dev/sometty

       sets the default serial device for ncpd. Without this option,
       ncpd tries automagically to find a serial device.

  --with-speed=baudrate

       sets the default serial speed (normally 115200 baud).

  --with-port=portnum

       sets the default port on which ncpd listens and to which plpftp
       and plpfuse connect (default 7501).

  --with-drive=drivespec

       sets the default drive for plpftp. The default "AUTO"
       triggers a drive-scan on the psion and sets the drive to the
       first drive found. If you don't want that, specify "C:" for
       example.

  --with-basedir=dirspec

       overrides the default directory for plpftp. The default is \
       which means the root directory. Note: since backslashes need to
       be doubled once for C escaping and once for shell escaping,
       this value is actually supplied as "\\\\".


macOS-specific instructions
---------------------------

To build plptools on macOS, you need to install the GNU readline library.
Assuming Homebrew is your package manager:

brew install readline

In order to enable readline and history support, you need to properly
configure the build:

LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix readline)/lib" \
CPPFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix readline)/include" ./configure

Then you can build and install the package:

make
make install
